# QR Code Scanner

This project is a simple QR Code scanner built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload an image containing a QR code and then decodes the content of the QR code. If the decoded text is a URL, it will be rendered as a clickable link.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload images containing QR codes via file input or drag-and-drop.
- **QR Code Decoding**: Uses the jsQR library to decode the QR code from the image.
- **URL Detection**: Automatically identifies URLs in the decoded data and renders them as clickable links.

## Files in this Project

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the QR Code scanner interface.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that styles the scanner's user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles image uploads, QR code decoding using jsQR, and dynamic UI updates.
